# Expense-Tracker-Application

This repository contains the source code for my individual project, **Expense Tracker Application**, developed as part of the **CPSC210** course at the University of British Columbia (UBC). The project was created between January and April of 2024.

## Background

Initially, this project was hosted on a course-specific GitHub account. Unfortunately, I missed the opportunity to transfer the repository to my personal GitHub account before losing access to the course account. As a result, the repository history, including all commits and contributions, could not be preserved.

## Current Repository

The files uploaded here represent the final state of the project, retrieved directly from the original project folder on my local machine. While the Git history is unavailable, I remain the sole developer and author of the project.
